Future Tech Stack:
- Database:
  - MySQL or PostgreSQL
- Data Cleaning
  - Python for data maninpulation & preprocessing
  - Pandas for data analysis & manipulation
  - NumPy for numerical ops and handling large data sets
- Data visualizaion:
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn: For creating static visualizations like histograms, bar charts, and box plots.
  - Plotly: For interactive and dynamic visualizations that users can explore.
  - D3.js: If you are building a web-based visualization, D3.js is a powerful JavaScript library for creating complex and interactive visualizations.
- Front End
  - React.js or Vue.js
- Back end
  - Flask or Django for user auth & serving data to front end
